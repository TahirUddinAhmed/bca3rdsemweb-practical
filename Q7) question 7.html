        <p>Using HTML, a text file is further marked up with additional text describing how the document should be
            displayed. To keep the markup separate from the actual content of the HTML file, there is a special,
            distinguishing HTML syntax that is used. These special components are known as HTML tags. The tags can
            contain name-value pairs known as attributes, and a piece of content that is enclosed within a tag is
            referred to as an HTML element.

            HTML elements always have opening tags, content in the middle and closing tags. Attributes can provide
            additional information about the element and are included in the opening tag. Elements can be described in
            one of two ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Block-level elements start on a new line in the document and take up their own space. Examples of these
                elements include headings and paragraph tags.</li>
            <li>Inline elements do not start on a new line in the document and only take up necessary space. These
                elements usually format the contents of block-level elements. Examples of inline elements include
                hyperlinks and text format tags.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Pros and cons of HTML</h3>
        <p>Pros of using HTML include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Is widely adopted with a large amount of resources available.</li>
            <li>Is natively run on every browser.</li>
            <li>Is relatively easy to learn.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to use and implement HTML</h3>
        <p>Because HTML is completely text-based, an HTML file can be edited simply by opening it up in a program such
            as Notepad++, Vi or Emacs. Any text editor can be used to create or edit an HTML file and, so long as it is
            named with an .html file extension, any web browser -- such as Chrome or Firefox -- will be capable of
            displaying the file as a webpage.

            For professional software developers, there are a variety of WYSIWYG editors to develop webpages. NetBeans,
            IntelliJ, Eclipse and Microsoft's Visual Studio provide WYSIWYG editors as either plugins or as standard
            components, making it incredibly easy to use and implement HTML.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>These WYSIWYG editors also provide HTML troubleshooting facilities, although modern web browsers often
            contain web developer plugins that will highlight problems with HTML pages, such as a missing closing tag or
            syntax that does not create well-formed HTML.</p>

        <h3>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>HTML is used to create webpages but does experience limitations when it comes to fully responsive components.
            Therefore, HTML should only be used to add text elements and structure them within a page. For more complex
            features, HTML can be combined with cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS).</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>An HTML file can link to a cascading style sheet or JS file -- usually at the top of the document with a
            specified file path -- which will contain information about which colors to use, which fonts to use and
            other HTML element rendering information. JavaScript also allows developers to include more dynamic
            functionality, such as pop-ups and photo sliders, in a webpage. Tags called class attributes are used to
            match HTML elements to their corresponding CSS or JS elements.
