"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and 
praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and 
expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the 
master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure 
itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue 
pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 
Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself
, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil 
and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which 
of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some 
advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses 
to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain 
that produces no resultant pleasure? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not 
simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 
BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
 Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin 
words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites 
of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem 
Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et 
Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This 
book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance."
